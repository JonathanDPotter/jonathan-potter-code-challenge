# Jonathan Potter Coding Challenge
This is my attempt at the Pokedex coding challenge that I was asked to complete.

I did not meet a lot of the requirements of the challenge, and I had no time to style the app appropriately.

I successfully used redux toolkit to fetch data from the api and add it to the global store, I added a working filter for pokemon names and I implemented a "favorites" function that persists with local storage.
